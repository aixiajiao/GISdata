"Note: Healthy and regular Life Expectancy for men and women as a rolling average over three years. Healthy life expectancy shows the years a person can expect to live in good health (rather than with a disability or in poor health). Figures reflect the prevalence of good health and mortality among those living in an area in each time period, rather than what will be experienced throughout life among those born in the area.","","","",""
